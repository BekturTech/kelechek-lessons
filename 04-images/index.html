    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <img src="/04-images/img/html.png" alt="html" width="100" style="float: left;">
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 

        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
        
        Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
        Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
        Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
        It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 
        
        This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript. </p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p>CSS Advantages on Web Pages
        The difference between a web page that implements CSS and one that doesn’t is massive and surely noticeable.
        
        You might have seen a website that fails to load completely and has a white background color with most of the text being blue and black. This means that the CSS part of the web page didn’t load correctly or it doesn’t exist altogether.
        
        That’s what web pages with only HTML look like, and I think you’d agree that that’s not very appealing.
        Before using CSS, all of the stylizing had to be included into the HTML markup. This means web developers had to separately describe the background color, font size, alignments, etc.
        
        CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain.
        
        In short, with CSS features you don’t need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code, and makes it not as prone to errors.
        
        CSS lets you have multiple styles on one HTML page, therefore making the customization possibilities almost endless. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.
        
        How Does CSS Work?
        CSS uses a simple English based syntax with a set of rules that govern it. Like we’ve mentioned before, HTML was never intended to use style elements, only the markup of the page. It was created to merely describe the content. For example:
        
        But how do you style the paragraph? The CSS syntax structure is pretty simple. It has a selector and a declaration block. You select an element and then declare what you want to do with it. Pretty straightforward, right?
        
        However, there are rules you have to remember. The structure rules are pretty simple, so don’t worry.
        
        The selector points to the HTML elements you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
        
        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <img src="/04-images/img/js.png" alt="javascript" width="100" style="float: left;">
    <p><b>What Is JavaScript & Why Is It Important?</b></p>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language built for Netscape Navigator in 1995. All modern web browsers have since adopted it for adding functionality to websites and, more recently, web applications.

        Over the years since its inception, JavaScript has grown into a powerhouse. It is no longer only used by the web — it can now be found almost anywhere, including space.
        
        This post will discuss the origins, evolution, current landscape, and future of the JavaScript programming language. Without any further delay, let's jump right into the fun.</p>
